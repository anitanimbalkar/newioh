                <p class="bodytext">Usage of the Platform by Doctor is subject to acceptance of all Terms & Conditions described below and after signing an agreement by Clicking 'Terms & Conditions' in the Registration Process. Separately, Doctors will have to send a duly signed agreement along with self-attested copies of their ID proof, Address proof, Last Medical degree, and Registration Certificate with appropriate Medical Council. Ayushman largely depends on self-declaration but reserves the Right to conduct independent validation process.</p>

				<p class="bodytext"><strong>2.1. Rights to  Subscribe and Responsibilities thereof :</strong><br/></p>
					<p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">
					&bull; Any Doctor with Indian citizenship and holding a medical degree recognized by Government of India can register and subscribe to <em><strong>IndiaOnlineHealth</strong></em> as a Doctor, unless he is disqualified or barred by a government authority, any constitutional body or medical council of India or its subsidiaries. <br/><br/> 
					
					&bull; The Doctor is permitted to make use of <strong><em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em></strong> Platform and / or all the facilities available for genuine purposes only. The Doctor is not permitted to misuse <em><strong>IndiaOnlineHealth</strong></em> Platform and / or any facility available thereon, for any commercial, illegal, immoral, or unethical purpose. <br/><br/> 
					
					&bull; EMR is owned by the Consumer but he needs to give access to the Doctor, whom he is consulting. Accordingly, during Consultation, Doctor will have Rights to view EMR records of the Consumer. At other times, Doctor may ask Consumer and Consumer will have to give explicit access rights (such as before an upcoming appointment or to a family Doctor at all times) to his EMR.<br/><br/> 
					
					&bull; Doctor is solely responsible to decide if he needs to provide consultation on-line using Video / Audio / phone with the help of Consumer's EMR and reports. If in his opinion, he needs to do a physical examination, he should ask the patient to come for the same at his Clinic / hospital.<br/><br/> &bull; Doctor can publish his Profile with Clinic address and contact details. Doctor can also publish his 'In-Clinic' and 'On-line' Video / Audio / Phone Consultation calendar to enable Consumers to take appointment as appropriate. Doctor may make use of several scheduling related features to ensure that he maximizes his availability for Consumers, keeping waiting time to bare minimum.<br/><br/> 
					
					
					&bull; Under normal circumstances, Doctor is expected to meet with his patients at appointed time. However, if due to unavoidable circumstances, he needs to cancel an appointment, he must inform the patient well in advance (at least 24 hours in advance) or compensate by way of providing free consultation for a missed appointment.<br/>
					</p>
					<p class="bodytext"> <strong>2.2  Various Applicable Charges and Consultation Fees:</strong><br/><br/></p> 
					
					<p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">
					&bull; <strong>Registration</strong>: Registration is completely free for the Doctors.<br/><br/> 
					
					&bull; <strong>Annual Subscription:</strong> At this time, there are no Annual Subscription charges for Doctor to subscribe on <em><strong>IndiaOnlineHealth</strong></em>. However, Ayushman reserves the right to charge an annual subscription fee for enabling Doctor to publish his profile and calendar and offering their services through the Platform.<br/><br/> 
					
					&bull; <strong>Consultation Fees: </strong>				
					I &nbsp;Ayushman does not influence or control Consultation charges for their Services and the same are solely decided by individual Doctors.<br/><br/>
					
					II &nbsp;For 'In-Clinic' Consultation, Doctor may opt to ask Ayushman to block some amount from Consumer's account at the time of booking an appointment or allow booking of appointment with complete payment at the clinic. If he chooses to allow booking an appointment with full payment at the clinic, he needs to ensure that he collects all his charges. Ayushman will not be responsible for collection of his fees for such incidences.<br/><br/>
					
					III &nbsp; For 'On-line' consultation, Doctor will authorize Ayushman to block Consumers account with his full consultation fees at the time of booking. Once the Consultation is completed gracefully, the same amount will be credited to the Doctors account. If the Consultation is cancelled by the Consumer, his account will be credited back with the amount due to him as per cancellation policy. If cancellation is done by the Doctor, Consumer's account will be credited back with entire amount blocked for Doctors consultation.<br/>
					</p>
					<p class="bodytext"><strong>2.3</strong> <strong>Confidentiality:</strong><br/><br/></p>
					
					<p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">
						&bull; EMR of the Consumer is private information of the Consumer and its access to the Doctor is given solely for the purpose of enabling Doctor to provide highest quality of professional Service. Doctor needs to treat EMR and related information confidential. If any information needs to be shared with other authorized personnel (Doctor's Staff member, another Doctor, SSP, patient's close relative etc), it should strictly be on 'need-to-know basis' and in the interest of providing full and better advice. In such cases, Doctor is expected to take permission of the Consumer before sharing such information.<br/><br/>
					
						&bull; Doctor will ensure that his staff is made aware of the privacy involved in medical consultation and will not provide access to EMR of the Consumer and Consultation proceedings to staff except for 'need-to-know' basis. 
					   
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-6">
                   <p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">
					  
					   &bull; For On-line consultation, Doctor will ensure complete privacy from where he is providing consultation. <br/><br/>
					   
					   &bull; The information provided by the Doctor and the consultation records (examination details, diagnosis, prescription, investigations, medical or surgical procedures carried out or reports of such investigations etc) provided to the Consumer will be stored on the <em><strong>IndiaOnlineHealth</strong></em> Platform; said information and the proceedings stored on the <em><strong>IndiaOnlineHealth</strong></em> Platform will be accessible to Ayushman at all times; to which the Doctor will have no objection at any time. <br/><br/>
					   
					   &bull; Ayushman is at liberty to use the data for all legal purposes including medical research and statistics. When used for such purposes Ayushman will take utmost care to keep the identity of the Consumer and Doctor anonymous and confidential adhering to HIPPA guidelines. <br/><br/>
					   
					   &bull; The Doctor is solely responsible to keep his 'Access' related information such as user name, password and answers to challenge questions etc, as well as access to his email completely confidential.<br/>
					 </p>
					 
					 <p class="bodytext"><strong>2.4 Limitations of  Liabilities</strong><br/><br/></p>
					 
					 <p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">					 
					  &bull; Doctor needs to be aware and understand that providing an On-line Video / Audio / Phone consultation to a Consumer using <em><strong>IndiaOnlineHealth</strong></em> Platform poses certain limitations in providing advice as there is no physical examination of the Consumer by the Doctor. It is not equivalent to an In-clinic consultation. On-line Consultation is best suited for 'Follow-up' consultation and for consultation for routine ailments, not requiring physical examination. Under all circumstances, Doctor is solely responsible for deciding if 'On-line' Consulting is suitable for each specific situation.<br/><br/>
					  
					  &bull; All the services provided by Ayushman are technology based and using various Information Technology services, which mainly depend upon availability of power and network connectivity, and which are sometimes beyond the control of Ayushman. The Doctor avails of the service provided by <em><strong>IndiaOnlineHealth</strong></em> on an 'as-is' basis and assumes all the risks involved for the causes beyond Ayushman's control, with respect to any consequential damages arising out of nature of service, non-availability of service like power, network connectivity, any shortfall in completeness or loss of information stored, or loss of accuracy. <br/><br/>
					  
					  &bull; Each Doctor is an independent agent who provides services in his own individual capacity. If it is proven beyond doubt that the Doctor did not provide promised services, Ayushman can withhold payments of such deficient service in specific instances and money collected for that transaction can be credited back to the customer account. If a Doctor fails to keep an appointment due to any reason, he is obliged to refund the money collected for such transaction and give a free consultation slot at a subsequent time mutually suitable. Under such situations Ayushman will credit the customer account with the refund amount. <br/><br/>&bull; While Ayushman will take every care to safeguard customer data, Ayushman is not responsible for any accidental loss of data or service discontinuity and Doctor agrees to indemnify Ayushman against any and all consequential damages.<br/><br/>
					 
					</p>
					 <p class="bodytext"> <strong>2.5 Settlement of  Accounts:</strong><br/></p>
					 
					 <p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">				 
					  
					  &bull; Ayushman follows a monthly cycle of accounts reconciliation. By 15th of the following month, Ayushman will credit all amounts due to individual Doctors in their bank accounts provided by them at the time of registration or updated in their profile subsequently. A monthly statement will also be mailed to their email Id. Any disputes must be raised within 15 days from providing the monthly reconciliation statement.<br/><br/>
					  
					  &bull; Daily statements will be available in their account section updated on daily basis.<br/></p>
					  
					  <p class="bodytext"><strong>2.6 Termination of  Subscription:</strong><br/><br/></p>
					  
					  <p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">
					  &bull; The Subscription provided to the Doctors can be terminated by Ayushman at any time, if in the opinion of Ayushman, <br/><br/>
					  
					  &nbsp; 
						i. the Doctor is  misusing <strong><em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em></strong> Platform, <br /> 
						ii. the Doctor is  not using <strong><em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em></strong> Platform for genuine purpose,<br />
						iii. the Doctor is  using <strong><em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em></strong> Platform for commercial, illegal, immoral, or unethical purpose.<br/><br/>&bull; Doctor can decide to discontinue his license by informing Ayushman in writing accordingly. Any amount available in his account will be credited to his bank account at the end of the following reconciliation cycle.
