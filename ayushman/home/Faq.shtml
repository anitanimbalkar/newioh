		<div id="term" style="width:100%;padding-top:100px;"><h4 style="color:#04706d;">Frequently Asked  Questions on <em><u>IndiaOnlineHealth</u></em> </h4></div>
		<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			 <p class="bodytext"><strong>What is <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em> Service?</strong><br />
              It is a platform that enables members, doctors, pathologist  and drug stores to connect via the web and deliver seamless healthcare  services.</p>
             <p class="bodytext"><strong>How does it work?</strong><br />
				Members can constitute &lsquo;My panel of Doctors&rsquo; from the  registered doctors. If they need to consult a doctor they can book a time slot  and do online consulting via video, audio or&nbsp;  chat session. They can also consult their doctors on their panel via  secure email. </p>
              <p class="bodytext"><strong>What conditions are ideally suited for treatment via <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em>?</strong><br />
                Chronic situations needing frequent consultation; Follow-up visits  to show your doctor the test reports or update him on your progress on the  prescribed medication.
                You may have a pressing problem but you are unable to  physically visit the doctor immediately, 
                Common conditions such as common cold, flu, upset stomach,  throat infections, allergies, and other every day minor ailments</p>
              <p class="bodytext"><strong>Who can avail this service?</strong><br />
                It is available to all members who are registered as an  Individual, Family or a Corporate employee with <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em> ID  from any place in the world with an internet connection and ability to connect  to <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em> site 24x7, 365 days, limited only by the service  provider&rsquo;s (Doctors, Pathologist, Drug Stores) ability and availability to  service your request.</p>
              <p class="bodytext"><strong>Who is on the panel of doctors?</strong><br />
                Normally the doctors are empanelled based on your  recommendation. The aim is to enable you to consult your doctor and have  continuity in care while you are unable to visit your doctor or your doctor is  unable to see in his routine schedule. Some doctors may be empanelled based on  recommendation from other doctors on the panel. Once the doctor is on the <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em> panel, the members are free to avail of services from any of them.</p>
              <p class="bodytext"><strong>Why use <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em> when you prefer to visit  your doctor?</strong><br />
                While visiting your doctor for consulting is strongly  advised, several visits are superfluous and can be substituted with online  consulting saving you time, travel costs and commuting hassles. At times you  are unable to visit based on physical condition and preoccupation with other  pressing matters. Under such conditions online consulting is a better option  than postponing a doctor consultation. </p>
              <p class="bodytext"><strong>Why not do email consulting with your doctor?</strong><br />
                Video, audio or chat is better than email consulting as  online environment enables your doctor to investigate and understand your  symptoms better.</p>
              <p class="bodytext"><strong>Does <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em> obviate the need for you to  see your doctor personally?</strong><br />
                It is normally recommended that you visit your doctor  personally before doing online consulting. Once the doctor gets to know you and  your physical condition through personal examination, he is better equipped to  advice you online and suggest personal visit if he finds anything amiss.</p>
              <p class="bodytext"><strong>Does your doctor review your EMR before consulting?</strong><br />
                Yes, it is the best practice and members are advised to keep  their EMR up-to-date.</p>
              <p class="bodytext"><strong>Who creates your EMR?</strong><br />
                Soon after registration as a Member, the member is advised  to complete his EMR. Once he nominates a Family physician in his panel of  doctors, FP can assist him in completing certain sections that involve medical  conditions and terms that a member may be unfamiliar with. But the primary  responsibility for keeping the EMR up-to-date rests with the member or his  nominated guardian as the member may avail of health services outside of <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em>,  while he is a member and his record is known only to him before he enrolled as  a member.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			  <p class="bodytext"><strong>Who maintains the EMR?</strong><br />
                While you are a member, <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em> is  responsible for its safe keeping, following <em>HIPAA</em> regulations.  Anonymized records can be made available by <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em> for  training and medical research purposes.</p>
              <p class="bodytext"><strong>Can my Doctor view my EMR while I am meeting him in  person?</strong><br />
                Yes. We strongly encourage you to ask your doctor to look at  your EMR and record visit details, even during in-person consultation. This  will ensure that your EMR is always up-to-date. The prescription written by  your doctor will have much less chances of mistakes due to illegible  handwriting normally encountered with hand written prescription.</p>
              <p class="bodytext"><strong>What are the types of services provided by <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em>?</strong><br />
                  <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em> is a platform provider to connect  members with their doctors, pathologists and chemist. Center to the service is  Electronic Medical Record. Once you become a member, you have the facility to store  your EMR at a central place, which you and your doctors can access from  anywhere and at any time. <br/> </p>
              <p class="bodytext"><em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em> also provides a mechanism for you  to seek appointment with your doctor for an on-line consultation. The  tele-visit details are recorded by your doctor as a part of service he  provides. Visit report prepared by your doctor includes all vital information  including prescription, advice and request for investigations.</p>
              <p class="bodytext"><strong>Can you have a Specialist join the consulting session?</strong><br/>
              You or your doctors may request assistance of other  doctors during the consulting session or thereafter. You can request for a  multi-party consultation session and each party can log into the consultation call  remotely from wherever they are.</p>
              <p class="bodytext"><strong>Can your relatives join a consulting session?</strong><br />
                Yes. In case of a minor, it is highly recommended that the  guardian is present in the consultation either in person or remotely and the  guardian does not need any special permission. For other patients, member needs  to grant specific permission by inviting him into multi-party call. It is very  useful for Senior citizens to have their nominated children, or care taker  present during such consultation sessions either in person or remotely.</p>
              <p class="bodytext"><strong>Is there an age limit for <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em> membership?</strong><br />
                No, but for members whose age is below 18, will need a  guardian.<br/><br/>
			  <strong>What are the different types of membership?</strong><br/>
                There are multiple types of membership available. You can  join as an individual, as a family member, an employee of a participating  corporate organization or as a member of Special interest group like a housing  society.<strong> </strong>See our <u>tariff rates</u> for different types of membership.</p>
              <p class="bodytext"><strong><br/>How is the consulting fee collected from the member for  the services availed of?</strong><br />
                As a member, you are expected to charge/top up your account  with sufficient money to avail of the services. For On-line payment, <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em> has tied up with payment gateway that enables payment through credit card,  debit card and internet banking. <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em> is also making  arrangements to collect cash from home. In future, you may also be able to buy <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em> &ldquo;Coupons&rdquo; from other outlets.</p>
              <p class="bodytext"><strong><br/>What is the basis of fees levied?</strong><br />
                Normally there is a one-time registration fee and a nominal  per month fee payable to <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em> for maintaining member EMR.  Doctors are free to determine their own fee structure and payment is collected  by <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em> on their behalf and passed on to them entirely. <em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em> levies a small charge for the utilization of the platform while consulting. Quite  often, this fee may be less than what you spend on travel from your work place /  home to your doctor&rsquo;s clinic. </p>
