Consumer will have to register at site giving their actual  identity and not by any fake or assumed name.<br/><br/>
					
                    &bull; Every  Consumer irrespective of age, gender, or handicap status needs to have his /  her own account in his / her own name.<br/><br/>
					
					&bull; For children below the age of 18  years, registration has to be done by their parents / guardian and avail any  Services offered on this Platform under the supervision of a parent / guardian.<br/><br/>

The Consumer  is not permitted to misuse <strong><em>IndiaOnlineHealth </em></strong>Platform and / or  any facility available thereon, for any commercial, illegal, immoral, or  unethical purpose. <br/><br/>
					
					&bull; Since  many of the Services provided by Doctor / SSP / MES depend on past medical  history, it is the responsibility of the Consumer to ensure that his Electronic  Medical Records (EMR), (including his allergies, immunization, past medical  treatment, hereditary related family history, reports of medical check-ups,  prescription and consultation summary with Doctors) are kept current and  complete at all times. He should take assistance of his panel of Doctors in creating  and updating his EMR at various stages.<br/><br/>

				  </p>
                  <p class="bodytext"><strong>1.2. Various  Applicable Charges: </strong><br/></p>
				  
				  <p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">
					  &bull; <strong>Registration and Annual Subscription</strong>: Every subscriber needs to pay the registration  charges as applicable for his category of registration. In addition, he will  have to pay Annual Subscription to continue to access his records and avail  services offered by registered Doctors, SSP and MES as well as by Ayushman.

					  &bull; <strong>Doctor&rsquo;s and &lsquo;SSP&rsquo; Charges</strong>: Ayushman does not control Doctors, SSP and MESs  charges for their Services and the same are solely decided by respective  Service Providers. However, Aysuhman has been authorized by them to collect  their charges on their behalf and pass them through to respective Doctors, SSP  and MES. Therefore, while booking a slot for consultation or availing their  Services, Ayushman may block money as advance from Consumer equivalent to  charges of their Services. <br><br/>
					  
					  &bull; Consumer can pay for applicable charges by  different modes of payment, made available from time to time.

					  &bull; Doctors, Consulting specialists, SSP and MES are independent agents who give services in their own individual capacity. Ayushman is not in any way, responsible for individual acts of improper or incompetent advice or service provided by Doctors, Consulting specialists, or SSP. If it is proven beyond doubt that the promised services provided by the Doctor or SSP were not delivered, Ayushman can withhold payments to such service providers in specific instances and money collected for that transaction can be credited back to the customer account. If a Doctor fails to keep an appointment due to any reason, he is obliged to refund the money collected for such transaction and give a free consultation slot at a subsequent time mutually suitable. Under such situations Ayushman will credit the customer account with the refund amount. <br/><br>
					</p>  
					<p class="bodytext"><strong>1.5. Refunds:</strong><br/></p>
					
					<p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">
