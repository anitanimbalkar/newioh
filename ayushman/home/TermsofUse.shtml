                  <p class="bodytext">Usage of the Platform by Consumer is subject to acceptance of all Terms & Conditions described below and after signing an agreement by Clicking Terms & Conditions in the Registration Process.</p>			
				  </br>

				  </br>
				  <p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">
                    &bull; Any  Indian citizen can register and subscribe to <strong><em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em></strong> as  a Consumer, unless disqualified or barred by a government authority or any  constitutional body. Consumer will have to register at site giving their actual  identity and not by any fake or assumed name.<br/><br/>
					
                    &bull; Every  Consumer irrespective of age, gender, or handicap status needs to have his /  her own account in his / her own name.<br/><br/>
					
					&bull; For children below the age of 18  years, registration has to be done by their parents / guardian and avail any  Services offered on this Platform under the supervision of a parent / guardian.<br/><br/>
					
					&bull; For  senior citizens, handicapped persons and other adults, who are not comfortable  with use of Computer / Internet technologies, registration may be done on their  behalf by a relative / friend. In such cases, he will have to declare that he  is authorized by the Subscriber and act as guardian, while using the Services.<br/><br/>
				
					&bull; The  Consumer is permitted to make use of <strong><em>IndiaOnlineHealth </em></strong>Platform  and / or all the facilities available for genuine purposes only. The Consumer  is not permitted to misuse <strong><em>IndiaOnlineHealth </em></strong>Platform and / or  any facility available thereon, for any commercial, illegal, immoral, or  unethical purpose. <br/><br/>
					
					&bull; Since  many of the Services provided by Doctor / SSP / MES depend on past medical  history, it is the responsibility of the Consumer to ensure that his Electronic  Medical Records (EMR), (including his allergies, immunization, past medical  treatment, hereditary related family history, reports of medical check-ups,  prescription and consultation summary with Doctors) are kept current and  complete at all times. He should take assistance of his panel of Doctors in creating  and updating his EMR at various stages.<br/><br/>
					
					&bull; EMR is owned by the patient but he needs to give  access to the Doctor, whom he is consulting. During Consultation, he will deem  to have given access rights to the Consulting Doctor. At other times, Consumer  will have to give explicit rights (such as before an upcoming appointment or to  a family Doctor at all times), if he wishes to allow specific Doctors to have  access these records. <br/>
				  </p>
				  </br>
                  <p class="bodytext"><strong>1.2. Various  Applicable Charges: </strong><br/></p>
				  </br>
				  <p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">
					  &bull; <strong>Registration and Annual Subscription</strong>: Every subscriber needs to pay the registration  charges as applicable for his category of registration. In addition, he will  have to pay Annual Subscription to continue to access his records and avail  services offered by registered Doctors, SSP and MES as well as by Ayushman. If Consumer  fails to renew the subscription before expiry of current period, Ayushman  reserves the right to disable his access to his EMR and all other services  available to him by way of his subscription.<br/><br/>
					  
					  &bull; <strong>Usage</strong>: Certain services offered by Ayushman may attract  usage charges on per transaction basis based on package subscribed. Consumer  will be required to pay these transaction charges as applicable. <br/><br/>
					  
					  &bull; <strong>Doctor&rsquo;s and &lsquo;SSP&rsquo; Charges</strong>: Ayushman does not control Doctors, SSP and MESs  charges for their Services and the same are solely decided by respective  Service Providers. However, Aysuhman has been authorized by them to collect  their charges on their behalf and pass them through to respective Doctors, SSP  and MES. Therefore, while booking a slot for consultation or availing their  Services, Ayushman may block money as advance from Consumer equivalent to  charges of their Services. <br><br/>
					  
					  &bull; Consumer can pay for applicable charges by  different modes of payment, made available from time to time. These may include  On-line payment through Credit Card, Internet banking, transfer of funds  through banking channels or Cash collection mechanisms at the discretion of  Ayushman. <br/><br/>
					  
					  &bull; It is advised that Consumer keeps sufficient  positive balance in his account at all times to ensure, he is able to fix  appointment quickly. Consumer can view his transaction details and balance at  any time by accessing his account under his log-in to the site.<br/>
					  
				  </p>
				  </br>
                  <p class="bodytext"><strong>1.3</strong>. <strong>Confidentiality:</strong> <br/></p>
				  </br>
				  <p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">
					&bull; The information provided by the Consumer and the  proceedings of the meeting of the Consumer with the Doctor, as also with  
					the SSP  and MES; advice given by the Doctor, details of services provided by the SSP  and MES, will be stored on the <strong><em>IndiaOnlineHealth </em></strong>Platform; said information and the proceedings stored on  the <strong><em>IndiaOnlineHealth </em></strong> Platform will be accessible to Ayushman at  all times; to which the Consumer will have no objection at any time.<br/><br/>
					  
					&bull; Ayushman  is at liberty to use the data for all legal purposes including medical research  and statistics. When used for such purposes, Ayushman will take utmost care to  keep the identity of the Consumer anonymous and confidential adhering to HIPPA  guidelines. <br/><br/>
				
					&bull; The Consumer is solely responsible to keep his Access related information such as user name, password and answers to challenge questions etc, as well as access to his mail Id completely confidential. <br/><br/>
				  </p>	
				  <p class="bodytext"><strong>1.4. Limitations of Liabilities </strong> <br/></p>
				  </br>
				  <p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">
					  &bull; Consumer needs to be aware and understand that availing an On-line Video / Audio / Phone consultation with a Doctor using <em><strong>IndiaOnlineHealth</strong></em> Platform poses certain limitations in providing advice as there is no physical examination of the Consumer by the Doctor. It is not equivalent to an In-clinic consultation. On-line Consultation is best suited for Follow-up consultation and for consultation for routine ailments, not requiring physical examination. <br/><br/>
					  
					  &bull; Ayushman is not responsible or liable for any advice provided by Doctor and for any services provided by SSP and MES or for any consequences of the advice provided by Doctor and for any consequences of any services provided by SSP and MES. <br/><br/>
					  
					  &bull; All the services provided by Ayushman are technology based and using various Information Technology services, which mainly depend upon availability of power and network connectivity, which are sometimes beyond the control of Ayushman. The Consumer avails of the service provided by <em><strong>IndiaOnlineHealth</strong></em> on an as-is basis and assumes all the risks involved for the causes beyond Ayushman control, with respect to any consequential damages arising out of nature of service, non-availability of service like power, network connectivity, any shortfall in completeness or loss of information stored, or loss of accuracy. <br/><br/>
					  
					  &bull; Doctors, Consulting specialists, SSP and MES are independent agents who give services in their own individual capacity. Ayushman is not in any way, responsible for individual acts of improper or incompetent advice or service provided by Doctors, Consulting specialists, or SSP. If it is proven beyond doubt that the promised services provided by the Doctor or SSP were not delivered, Ayushman can withhold payments to such service providers in specific instances and money collected for that transaction can be credited back to the customer account. If a Doctor fails to keep an appointment due to any reason, he is obliged to refund the money collected for such transaction and give a free consultation slot at a subsequent time mutually suitable. Under such situations Ayushman will credit the customer account with the refund amount. <br/><br>
					</p>  
					<p class="bodytext"><strong>1.5. Refunds:</strong></p>
					</br>
					
					<p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">  
					  &bull; The registration and subscription amount as well as amount paid towards already availed services by the Consumer to Ayushman, is not refundable.<br/><br/>
					  
					  &bull; <strong>Shortcoming in Service by &lsquo;Doctor&rsquo;, &lsquo;SSP&rsquo; and &lsquo;MESP&rsquo;</strong>: If Consumer informs Ayushman in writing about shortcoming in services provided by Doctor or SSP, Ayushman will investigate the claim and at its sole discretion, may refund a part or full amount paid / deposited by the Consumer to Ayushman, in case the designated service provider has failed to deliver service in part or full. Any such complaint must be reported within 72 hours of such an act happening. In any case, the claim and refund will never exceed the amount paid towards services provided for this specific act.<br/><br/>
					</p>
					  
					<p class="bodytext"><strong>1.6. Termination of  Subscription:</strong></p>
					</br>
					<p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">  
						&bull; The Subscription provided to the Consumer can be terminated by Ayushman at any time, if in the opinion of Ayushman,  <br />
							i  	&nbsp;&nbsp;the Consumer is misusing <em><strong>IndiaOnlineHealth</strong></em> Platform,  <br />
							ii&nbsp;	the Consumer is not using IndiaOnlineHealth Platform for genuine purpose,  <br />
							iii&nbsp; the  Consumer is using <strong><em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em></strong> Platform for commercial,  illegal, immoral, or unethical purpose.<br/><br/>
							
						&bull; The services will be terminated in case Consumer fails to pay the annual subscription charges within 15 days of his subscription becoming due.  EMR will not be accessible to the Consumer once the account is closed. However, if the Consumer reactivates his account upon payment of outstanding dues, within 90 days, access to his EMR can be reactivated. <br/><br/>
						
						&bull; If the Consumer decides to close his account and inform Ayushman in writing accordingly, any amount available to his credit balance will be refunded to him by 15th day of the following calendar month.<br/><br/>

					</br>
					<p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">
					&bull; Any Doctor with Indian citizenship and holding a medical degree recognized by Government of India can register and subscribe to <em><strong>IndiaOnlineHealth</strong></em> as a Doctor, unless he is disqualified or barred by a government authority, any constitutional body or medical council of India or its subsidiaries. <br/><br/> 
					
					&bull; The Doctor is permitted to make use of <strong><em>IndiaOnlineHealth</em></strong> Platform and / or all the facilities available for genuine purposes only. The Doctor is not permitted to misuse <em><strong>IndiaOnlineHealth</strong></em> Platform and / or any facility available thereon, for any commercial, illegal, immoral, or unethical purpose. <br/><br/> 
					
					&bull; EMR is owned by the Consumer but he needs to give access to the Doctor, whom he is consulting. Accordingly, during Consultation, Doctor will have Rights to view EMR records of the Consumer. At other times, Doctor may ask Consumer and Consumer will have to give explicit access rights (such as before an upcoming appointment or to a family Doctor at all times) to his EMR.<br/><br/> 
					
					&bull; Doctor is solely responsible to decide if he needs to provide consultation on-line using Video / Audio / phone with the help of Consumer's EMR and reports. If in his opinion, he needs to do a physical examination, he should ask the patient to come for the same at his Clinic / hospital.<br/><br/> &bull; Doctor can publish his Profile with Clinic address and contact details. Doctor can also publish his 'In-Clinic' and 'On-line' Video / Audio / Phone Consultation calendar to enable Consumers to take appointment as appropriate. Doctor may make use of several scheduling related features to ensure that he maximizes his availability for Consumers, keeping waiting time to bare minimum.<br/><br/> 
					
					
					&bull; Under normal circumstances, Doctor is expected to meet with his patients at appointed time. However, if due to unavoidable circumstances, he needs to cancel an appointment, he must inform the patient well in advance (at least 24 hours in advance) or compensate by way of providing free consultation for a missed appointment.<br/>

					<p class="bodytext"> <strong>2.2  Various Applicable Charges and Consultation Fees:</strong></p> 
					</br>
					
					<p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">
					&bull; <strong>Registration</strong>: Registration is completely free for the Doctors.<br/><br/> 
					
					&bull; <strong>Annual Subscription:</strong> At this time, there are no Annual Subscription charges for Doctor to subscribe on <em><strong>IndiaOnlineHealth</strong></em>. However, Ayushman reserves the right to charge an annual subscription fee for enabling Doctor to publish his profile and calendar and offering their services through the Platform.<br/><br/> 
					
					&bull; <strong>Consultation Fees: </strong>				
					I &nbsp;Ayushman does not influence or control Consultation charges for their Services and the same are solely decided by individual Doctors.<br/><br/>
					
					II &nbsp;For 'In-Clinic' Consultation, Doctor may opt to ask Ayushman to block some amount from Consumer's account at the time of booking an appointment or allow booking of appointment with complete payment at the clinic. If he chooses to allow booking an appointment with full payment at the clinic, he needs to ensure that he collects all his charges. Ayushman will not be responsible for collection of his fees for such incidences.<br/><br/>

					</br>
					<p class="bodytext" style="padding-left:15px;">
						&bull; EMR of the Consumer is private information of the Consumer and its access to the Doctor is given solely for the purpose of enabling Doctor to provide highest quality of professional Service. Doctor needs to treat EMR and related information confidential. If any information needs to be shared with other authorized personnel (Doctor's Staff member, another Doctor, SSP, patient's close relative etc), it should strictly be on 'need-to-know basis' and in the interest of providing full and better advice. In such cases, Doctor is expected to take permission of the Consumer before sharing such information.<br/><br/>
					
						&bull; Doctor will ensure that his staff is made aware of the privacy involved in medical consultation and will not provide access to EMR of the Consumer and Consultation proceedings to staff except for 'need-to-know' basis. 
					     
					   &bull; For On-line consultation, Doctor will ensure complete privacy from where he is providing consultation. <br/><br/>
					   
					   &bull; The information provided by the Doctor and the consultation records (examination details, diagnosis, prescription, investigations, medical or surgical procedures carried out or reports of such investigations etc) provided to the Consumer will be stored on the <em><strong>IndiaOnlineHealth</strong></em> Platform; said information and the proceedings stored on the <em><strong>IndiaOnlineHealth</strong></em> Platform will be accessible to Ayushman at all times; to which the Doctor will have no objection at any time. <br/><br/>

					  &bull; All the services provided by Ayushman are technology based and using various Information Technology services, which mainly depend upon availability of power and network connectivity, and which are sometimes beyond the control of Ayushman.

					  &bull; Each Doctor is an independent agent who provides services in his own individual capacity. If it is proven beyond doubt that the Doctor did not provide promised services, Ayushman can withhold payments of such deficient service in specific instances and money collected for that transaction can be credited back to the customer account. If a Doctor fails to keep an appointment due to any reason, he is obliged to refund the money collected for such transaction and give a free consultation slot at a subsequent time mutually suitable. Under such situations Ayushman will credit the customer account with the refund amount. <br/><br/>&bull; While Ayushman will take every care to safeguard customer data, Ayushman is not responsible for any accidental loss of data or service discontinuity and Doctor agrees to indemnify Ayushman against any and all consequential damages.
