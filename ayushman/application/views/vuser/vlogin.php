Then it's about time you picked up Head First HTML with CSS \u0026amp; XHTML and really learned HTML. You want to learn HTML so you can finally create those web pages you've always wanted, so you can communicate more effectively with friends, family, fans, and fanatic customers. You also want to do it right so you can actually maintain and expand your Web pages over time, and so your web pages work in all the browsers and mobile devices out there. Oh, and if you've never heard of CSS, that's okay - we won't tell anyone you're still partying like it's 1999 - but if you're going to create Web pages in the 21st century then you'll want to know and understand CSS. Learn the real secrets of creating Web pages, and why everything your boss told you about HTML tables is probably wrong (and what to do instead). Most importantly, hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions how his HTML is now strict, and his CSS is in an external style sheet.With Head First HTML with CSS \u0026amp; XHTML, you'll avoid the embarrassment of thinking web-safe colors still matter, and the foolishness of slipping a font tag into your pages. Best of all, you'll learn HTML and CSS in a way that won't put you to sleep. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect: a visually-rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, this book will load HTML, CSS, and XHTML into your brain in a way that sticks.So what are you waiting for? Leave those other dusty books behind and come join us in Webville. Your tour is about to begin.\"Elegant design is at the core of every chapter here, each concept conveyed with equal doses of pragmatism and wit.\" --Ken Goldstein, Executive Vice President, Disney Online\"This book is a thoroughly modern introduction to forward-looking practices in web page markup and presentation.\" --Danny Goodman, author of Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Guide\"What used to be a long trial and error learning process has now been reduced neatly into an engaging paperback.\" --Mike Davidson, CEO, Newsvine, Inc.\"I love Head First HTML with CSS \u0026amp; XHTML--it teaches you everything you need to learn in a 'fun coated' format!\" --Sally Applin, UI Designer and Artist\"I haven't had as much fun reading a book (other than Harry Potter) in years. And your book finally helped me break out of my hapless so-last-century way of creating web pages.\" --Professor David M. Arnow, Department of Computer and Information Science, Brooklyn College\"If you've ever had a family member who wanted you to design a website for them, buy them Head First HTML with CSS and XHTML. If you've ever asked a family member to design you a web site, buy this book. If you've ever bought an HTML book and ended up using it to level your desk, or for kindling on a cold winter day, buy this book. This is the book you've been waiting for.

At any given moment, somewhere in the world someone struggles with the same software design problems you have. You know you don't want to reinvent the wheel (or worse, a flat tire), so you look to Design Patterns--the lessons learned by those who've faced the same problems. With Design Patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others, so that you can spend your time on...something else. Something more challenging. Something more complex. Something more fun. You want to learn about the patterns that matter--why to use them, when to use them, how to use them (and when NOT to use them). But you don't just want to see how patterns look in a book, you want to know how they look \"in the wild\". In their native environment. In other words, in real world applications. You also want to learn how patterns are used in the Java API, and how to exploit Java's built-in pattern support in your own code. You want to learn the real OO design principles and why everything your boss told you about inheritance might be wrong (and what to do instead). You want to learn how those principles will help the next time you're up a creek without a design pattern. Most importantly, you want to learn the \"secret language\" of Design Patterns so that you can hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions his stunningly clever use of Command, Facade, Proxy, and Factory in between sips of a martini. You'll easily counter with your deep understanding of why Singleton isn't as simple as it sounds, how the Factory is so often misunderstood, or on the real relationship between Decorator, Facade and Adapter. With Head First Design Patterns, you'll avoid the embarrassment of thinking Decorator is something from the \"Trading Spaces\" show. Best of all, in a way that won't put you to sleep! We think your time is too important (and too short) to spend it struggling with academic texts. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, Head First Design Patterns will load patterns into your brain in a way that sticks.

In a way that makes you better at solving software design problems, and better at speaking the language of patterns with others on your team.","htmldescription":"ER","msrp":"49.99","slots":"1","hits":"178197","imagesmall":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/images\/0596007124\/0596007124_cs.gif","imagemedium":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/images\/0596007124\/0596007124_xs.gif","imagelarge":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/images\/0596007124\/0596007124_s.gif","buyprint":"http:\/\/shop.oreilly.com\/ExternalAddToBasket.do?skuCode=SKU-KIT-9780596007126.BOOK\u0026qty=1","offlinecontentlist":{"offlineunit":[{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-PREFACE-1","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-DEDICATION","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-PREFACE-3","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-PREFACE-5","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-PREFACE-4","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-PREFACE-2","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-CHP-1","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-CHP-2","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-CHP-3","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-CHP-4","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-CHP-5","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-CHP-6","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-CHP-7","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-CHP-8","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-CHP-9","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-CHP-10","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-CHP-11","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-CHP-12","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-CHP-13","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"hfdesignpat-APP-A","tokens":"1"}}]},"relatedfiles":{"filegroup":[{"description":"Visit the catalog page for Head First Design Patterns","ulink":"Catalog Page"},{"description":"Visit the errata page for Head First Design Patterns","ulink":"Errata"},{"description":"Download the supplemental electronic content for Head First Design Patterns","ulink":"Supplemental Content"},{}]},"nextsection":{"@attributes":{"id":"0596007124\/firstchapter"}},"section":{"@attributes":{"id":"0596007124","rank":"1","position":"1"},"url":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/0596007124","heading":{},"type":{},"title":"Head First Design Patterns"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"9781430236054","rank":"1","position":"2"},"rights":"Copyright \u00a9 2011 by Dave Mark, Jack Nutting, Jeff LaMarche","language":"en","contenttype":{"@attributes":{"role":"book"}},"formattypes":{"@attributes":{"recommended":"PrintFidelity"},"type":[{"@attributes":{"format":"HTML","source":"EPUB"}},{"@attributes":{"format":"PrintFidelity"}}]},"contentstate":{"@attributes":{"mode":"active"}},"isbn":"9781430236054","title":"Beginning iOS 5 Development: Exploring the iOS SDK","dateadded":"2011\/12\/20","dateupdated":"2012\/02\/09","url":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/9781430236054","aliases":{"alias":[{"@attributes":{"type":"isbn","label":"Print ISBN-10","name":"1430236051","display":"1-430236-05-1"}},{"@attributes":{"type":"isbn13","label":"Print ISBN-13","name":"9781430236054","display":"978-1-4302-3605-4"}}]},"edition":"1","authorgroup":{"author":[{"firstname":"Dave","surname":"Mark"},{"firstname":"Jack","surname":"Nutting"},{"firstname":"Jeff","surname":"LaMarche"}]},"authors":"Dave Mark; Jack Nutting; Jeff LaMarche","pagenums":"750","pubdate":"December 7, 2011","subjectset":{},"categories":{"category":["iPhone","IOS","Apple"]},"publisher":{"publishername":"Apress","imprintname":"Apress"},"description":"ERThe team that brought you the bestselling Beginning iPhone 4 Development is back again for Beginning iOS 5 Development, bringing this definitive guide up-to-date with Apple's latest and greatest iOS SDK, as well as with the latest version of Xcode.There's coverage of brand new technologies, with chapters on storyboards and iCloud, for example, as well as significant updates to existing chapters to bring them in line with all the changes that came with the iOS 5 SDK. You'll have everything you need to create your very own apps for the latest iOS devices, including the iPhone 4S, iPad 2, and the latest iPod touch. Every single sample program in the book has been rebuilt from scratch using Xcode 4.2 and the latest iOS 5-specific project templates and designed to take advantage of the latest Xcode features.Assuming only a minimal working knowledge of Objective-C, and written in a friendly, easy-to-follow style, Beginning iOS 5 Development offers a complete soup-to-nuts course in iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch programming. The book starts with the basics, walking through the process of downloading and installing Xcode and the iOS 5 SDK, and then guides you though the creation of your first simple application.From there, you'll learn how to integrate all the interface elements Apple touch users have come to know and love, such as buttons, switches, pickers, toolbars, and sliders. You'll master a variety of design patterns, from the simplest single view to complex hierarchical drill-downs. The confusing art of table building will be demystified, and you'll learn how to save your data using the iPhone file system. You'll also learn how to save and retrieve your data using a variety of persistence techniques, including Core Data and SQLite. And there's much more! You'll learn to draw using Quartz 2D and OpenGL ES, add multitouch gestural support (pinches and swipes) to your applications, and work with the camera, photo library, accelerometer, and built-in GPS.

You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study. The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. That's how your brain knows. And that's how your brain will learn Java. Head First Java combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java. You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI. And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform. Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required. So learning the Head First way is more important than ever. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read. By exploiting how your brain works, Head First Java compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information. Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book. But if you want to understand Java, this book's for you.","htmldescription":"ER","msrp":"44.95","slots":"1","hits":"140589","imagesmall":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/images\/0596009208\/0596009208_cs.gif","imagemedium":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/images\/0596009208\/0596009208_xs.gif","imagelarge":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/images\/0596009208\/0596009208_s.gif","buyprint":"http:\/\/shop.oreilly.com\/ExternalAddToBasket.do?skuCode=SKU-KIT-9780596009205.BOOK\u0026qty=1","offlinecontentlist":{"offlineunit":[{"@attributes":{"role":"book","tokens":"18"},"0":"\n\t\t"},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"preface","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"what_they_number_symble_re_saying_about","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"praise_for_head_first_java","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"praise_for_other_head_first_books_co-aut","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"creators_of_the_head_first_series","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"intro_colon_how_to_use_this_book","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"dive_in_a_quick_dip_colon_breaking_the_s","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"classes_and_objects_colon_a_trip_to_obje","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"primitives_and_references_colon_know_you","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"methods_use_instance_variables_colon_how","tokens":"1","view":"public"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"writing_a_program_colon_extra-strength_m","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"get_to_know_the_java_api_colon_using_the","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"inheritance_and_polymorphism_colon_bette","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"interfaces_and_abstract_classes_colon_se","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"constructors_and_garbage_collection_colo","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"numbers_and_statics_colon_numbers_matter","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"exception_handling_colon_risky_behavior","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"getting_gui_colon_a_very_graphic_story","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"using_swing_colon_work_on_your_swing","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"serialization_and_file_i_solidus_o_colon","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"networking_and_threads_colon_make_a_conn","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"collections_and_generics_colon_data_stru","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"package_comma_jars_and_deployment_colon","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"remote_deployment_with_rmi_colon_distrib","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"final_code_kitchen","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"the_top_ten_topics_that_almost_made_it","tokens":"1"}}]},"relatedfiles":{"filegroup":[{"description":"Visit the catalog page for Head First Java, Second Edition","ulink":"Catalog Page"},{"description":"Visit the errata page for Head First Java, Second Edition","ulink":"Errata"},{"description":"Download the supplemental electronic content for Head First Java, Second Edition","ulink":"Supplemental Content"},{}]},"nextsection":{"@attributes":{"id":"0596009208\/firstchapter"}},"section":{"@attributes":{"id":"0596009208","rank":"1","position":"4"},"url":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/0596009208","heading":{},"type":{},"title":"Head First Java"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"9781449311988","rank":"1","position":"5"},"rights":"Copyright \u00a9 2011 Ryan Benedetti and Ronan Cranley","language":"en","contenttype":{"@attributes":{"role":"book"}},"formattypes":{"@attributes":{"recommended":"PrintFidelity"},"type":[{"@attributes":{"format":"HTML","source":"Docbook","displayRestricted":"true"}},{"@attributes":{"format":"PrintFidelity"}}]},"contentstate":{"@attributes":{"mode":"active"}},"isbn":"9781449311988","title":"Head First jQuery","dateadded":"2011\/07\/16","dateupdated":"2011\/10\/06","url":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/9781449311988","aliases":{"alias":{"@attributes":{"type":"isbn13","label":"Print ISBN-13","name":"9781449393212","display":"978-1-4493-9321-2"}}},"edition":"1","authorgroup":{"author":[{"firstname":"Ryan Benedetti","authorblurb":{"@attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/www.oreillynet.com\/pub\/au\/3547"}}},{"firstname":"Ronan Cranley","authorblurb":{"@attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/www.oreillynet.com\/pub\/au\/4803"}}}]},"authors":"Ryan Benedetti; Ronan Cranley","pagenums":"544","pubdate":"September 22, 2011","subjectset":{},"categories":{"category":["Web Design \u0026 Development","JQuery"]},"publisher":{"publishername":"O'Reilly Media, Inc.","imprintname":"O'Reilly Media"},"description":"ERWant to add more interactivity and polish to your websites?

platform. It provides a radically new high-productivity programming model that promotes cleaner code architecture, test-driven development, and powerful extensibility, combined with all the benefits of ASP.NET 4. In this, the third edition, the core model-view-controller (MVC) architectural concepts are not simply explained or discussed in isolation, but are demonstrated in action. You'll work through an extended tutorial to create a working e-commerce web application that combines ASP.NET MVC with the latest C# language features and unit-testing best practices. By gaining this invaluable, practical experience, you'll discover MVC's strengths and weaknesses for yourselfand put your best-learned theory into practice. The book's authors, Steve Sanderson and Adam Freeman, have both watched the growth of ASP.NET MVC since its first release. Steve is a well known blogger on the MVC Framework and a member of the Microsoft Web Platform and Tools team. Adam started designing and building web applications 15 years ago and has been responsible for some of the world's largest and most ambitious projects. You can be sure you are in safe hands.

This book will get you way up to speed on the technology you'll know it so well, in fact, that you can pass the brand new J2EE 1.5 exam. If that's what you want to do, that is. Maybe you don't care about the exam, but need to use servlets and JSPs in your next project. You're working on a deadline. You're over the legal limit for caffeine. You can't waste your time with a book that makes sense only AFTER you're an expert (or worse, one that puts you to sleep). Learn how to write servlets and JSPs, what makes a web container tick (and what ticks it off), how to use JSP's Expression Language (EL for short), and how to write deployment descriptors for your web applications. Master the c:out tag, and get a handle on exactly what's changed since the older J2EE 1.4 exam. You don't just pass the new J2EE 1.5 SCWCD exam, you'll understand this stuff and put it to work immediately.

Because of this, both beginners and experienced programmers alike can use this book to quickly and effectively learn the fundamentals of Objective-C.Readers can also learn the concepts of object-oriented programming without having to first learn all of the intricacies of the underlying C programming language. This unique approach to learning, combined with many small program examples and exercises at the end of each chapter, makes Programming in Objective-C ideally suited for either classroom use or self-study.The fourth edition of this book has been updated to cover the significant changes that first appeared in iOS 5 and Xcode 4.2, including the use of Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to improve and simplify memory management in Objective-C programs.","htmldescription":"ER","msrp":"49.99","slots":"1","hits":"95413","imagesmall":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/images\/9780132900904\/9780132900904_cs.jpg","imagemedium":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/images\/9780132900904\/9780132900904_xs.jpg","imagelarge":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/images\/9780132900904\/9780132900904_s.jpg","buyprint":"http:\/\/www.informit.com\/title\/9780321811905","offlinecontentlist":{"offlineunit":[{"@attributes":{"role":"book","tokens":"16"},"file":[{"@attributes":{"format":"epub","url":"e-formats\/9780132900904.epub"}},{"@attributes":{"format":"mobi","url":"e-formats\/9780132900904.mobi"}}]},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"pre01","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"toc1","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"pre02","tokens":"0","view":"public"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"pre03","tokens":"0","view":"public"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"pre04","tokens":"0","view":"public"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"pre05","tokens":"0","view":"public"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch01","tokens":"1","view":"public"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch02","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch03","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch04","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch05","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch06","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch07","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch08","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch09","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch10","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch11","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch12","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch13","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch14","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch15","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch16","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch17","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch18","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch19","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch20","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch21","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"app01","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"app02","tokens":"1"}}]},"nextsection":{"@attributes":{"id":"9780132900904\/firstchapter"}},"section":{"@attributes":{"id":"9780132900904","rank":"1","position":"12"},"url":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/9780132900904","heading":{},"type":{},"title":"Programming in Objective-C, Fourth Edition"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"9781118133453","rank":"1","position":"13"},"rights":"Copyright \u00a9 2011 by Gawker Media","language":"en","contenttype":{"@attributes":{"role":"book"}},"formattypes":{"@attributes":{"recommended":"PrintFidelity"},"type":{"@attributes":{"format":"PrintFidelity"}}},"contentstate":{"@attributes":{"mode":"active"}},"isbn":"9781118133453","title":"Lifehacker: The Guide to Working Smarter, Faster, and Better, Third Edition","dateadded":"2011\/08\/26","dateupdated":"2011\/09\/01","url":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/9781118133453","aliases":{"alias":[{"@attributes":{"type":"isbn","label":"Print ISBN","name":"9781118133453","display":"978-1-118-01837-8"}},{"@attributes":{"type":"isbn","label":"Web ISBN","name":"1118018370","display":"1-118018-37-0"}}]},"edition":{},"authorgroup":{"author":[{"firstname":"Adam","surname":"Pash"},{"firstname":"Gina","surname":"Trapani"}],"authorblurb":{"@attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/www.wiley.com\/WileyCDA\/WileyTitle\/productCd-1118018370,descCd-authorInfo.html"}}},"authors":"Adam Pash; Gina Trapani","pagenums":"504","pubdate":"June 28, 2011","subjectset":{},"categories":{"category":"Personal Productivity"},"publisher":{"publishername":"John Wiley \u0026 Sons","imprintname":"John Wiley \u0026 Sons"},"description":"ER A new edition, packed with even more clever tricks and methods that make everyday life easier Lifehackers redefine personal productivity with creative and clever methods for making life easier and more enjoyable.

This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: SyntaxObjectsFunctionsInheritanceArraysRegular expressionsMethodsStyleBeautiful featuresThe real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.","htmldescription":"ER","msrp":"29.99","slots":"1","hits":"88072","imagesmall":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/images\/9780596517748\/9780596517748_cs.jpg","imagemedium":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/images\/9780596517748\/9780596517748_xs.jpg","imagelarge":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/images\/9780596517748\/9780596517748_s.jpg","buyprint":"http:\/\/shop.oreilly.com\/ExternalAddToBasket.do?skuCode=SKU-KIT-9780596517748.BOOK\u0026qty=1","offlinecontentlist":{"offlineunit":[{"@attributes":{"role":"book","tokens":"12"},"file":[{"@attributes":{"format":"epub","url":"e-formats\/9780596517748.epub"}},{"@attributes":{"format":"mobi","url":"e-formats\/9780596517748.mobi"}}]},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"kurt2safari_copyright_id","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"preface-id1","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"good_parts","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"grammar","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"objects","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"functions","tokens":"1","view":"public"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"inheritance","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"arrays","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"regular_expressions","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"methods","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"style","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"beautiful_features","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"awful_parts","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"bad_parts","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"jslint","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"syntax_diagrams","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"json","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"colophon","tokens":"0"}}]},"relatedfiles":{"filegroup":[{"description":"Visit the catalog page for JavaScript: The Good Parts","ulink":"Catalog Page"},{"description":"Visit the errata page for JavaScript: The Good Parts","ulink":"Errata"},{"description":"Download the supplemental electronic content for JavaScript: The Good Parts","ulink":"Supplemental Content"},{}]},"nextsection":{"@attributes":{"id":"9780596517748\/firstchapter"}},"section":{"@attributes":{"id":"9780596517748","rank":"1","position":"14"},"url":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/9780596517748","heading":{},"type":{},"title":"JavaScript: The Good Parts"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"9780136083238","rank":"1","position":"15"},"rights":"Copyright \u00a9 2009 Pearson Education, Inc.","language":"en","contenttype":{"@attributes":{"role":"book"}},"formattypes":{"@attributes":{"recommended":"PrintFidelity"},"type":[{"@attributes":{"format":"HTML","source":"Docbook"}},{"@attributes":{"format":"PrintFidelity"}}]},"contentstate":{"@attributes":{"mode":"active"}},"isbn":"9780136083238","title":"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship","dateadded":"2008\/06\/24","dateupdated":"2011\/11\/14","url":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/9780136083238","aliases":{"alias":[{"@attributes":{"type":"isbn","label":"Print ISBN-10","name":"0132350882","display":"0-13-235088-2"}},{"@attributes":{"type":"isbn13","label":"Print ISBN-13","name":"9780132350884","display":"978-0-13-235088-4"}},{"@attributes":{"type":"isbn","label":"Web ISBN-10","name":"0136083234","display":"0-13-608323-4"}},{"@attributes":{"type":"isbn13","label":"Web ISBN-13","name":"9780136083238","display":"978-0-13-608323-8"}}]},"edition":"First","authorgroup":{"author":{"firstname":"Robert","othername":"C.","surname":"Martin"}},"authors":"Robert C.

But if code isnt clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesnt have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code on the fly into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmerbut only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be doing? Youll be reading codelots of code. And you will be challenged to think about whats right about that code, and whats wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up codeof transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and smells gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. Readers will come away from this book understanding How to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.","htmldescription":"ER\n\t\t\n\t\t","msrp":"49.99","slots":"1","hits":"87494","imagesmall":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/images\/9780136083238\/9780136083238_cs.jpg","imagemedium":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/images\/9780136083238\/9780136083238_xs.jpg","imagelarge":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/images\/9780136083238\/9780136083238_s.jpg","buyprint":"http:\/\/www.informit.com\/title\/9780132350884","offlinecontentlist":{"offlineunit":[{"@attributes":{"role":"book","tokens":"16"},"file":[{"@attributes":{"format":"epub","url":"e-formats\/9780136083238.epub"}},{"@attributes":{"format":"mobi","url":"e-formats\/9780136083238.mobi"}}]},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"pref01","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"pref02","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"pref03","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"pref04","tokens":"0"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch01","view":"public","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch02","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch03","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch04","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch05","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch06","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch07","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch08","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch09","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch10","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch11","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch12","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch13","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch14","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch15","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch16","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"ch17","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"app01","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"app02","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"app03","tokens":"1"}},{"@attributes":{"linkid":"app04","tokens":"1"}}]},"nextsection":{"@attributes":{"id":"9780136083238\/firstchapter"}},"section":{"@attributes":{"id":"9780136083238","rank":"1","position":"15"},"url":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/9780136083238","heading":{},"type":{},"title":"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"9780132613477","rank":"1","position":"16"},"rights":"Copyright \u00a9 2012 Pearson Education, Inc.","contenttype":{"@attributes":{"role":"book"}},"formattypes":{"@attributes":{"recommended":"PrintFidelity"},"type":[{"@attributes":{"format":"HTML","source":"Docbook"}},{"@attributes":{"format":"PrintFidelity"}}]},"contentstate":{"@attributes":{"mode":"active"}},"isbn":"9780132613477","title":"The iOS 5 Developer\u2019s Cookbook: Core Concepts and Essential Recipes for iOS Programmers, Third Edition","dateadded":"2011\/10\/11","dateupdated":"2012\/01\/14","url":"http:\/\/my.safaribooksonline.com\/9780132613477","aliases":{"alias":[{"@attributes":{"type":"isbn","label":"Print ISBN-10","name":"0321754263","display":"0-321-75426-3"}},{"@attributes":{"type":"isbn13","label":"Print ISBN-13","name":"9780321754264","display":"978-0-321-75426-4"}},{"@attributes":{"type":"isbn","label":"Web ISBN-10","name":"0132613476","display":"0-13-261347-6"}},{"@attributes":{"type":"isbn13","label":"Web ISBN-13","name":"9780132613477","display":"978-0-13-261347-7"}}]},"edition":"Third","authorgroup":{"author":{"firstname":"Erica","surname":"Sadun"},"authorblurb":{"@attributes":{"url":"http:\/\/www.informit.com\/authors\/author_bio.aspx?ISBN=9780321754264"}}},"authors":"Erica Sadun","pagenums":"840","pubdate":"November 14, 2011","subjectset":{"subject":"Voodoo"},"categories":{"category":["Mobile","IOS","Apple"]},"publisher":{"publishername":"Addison-Wesley Professional","imprintname":"Addison-Wesley Professional"},"description":"ERUPDATE It has come to our attention that problems occurred during the production process of The iOS 5 Developer's Cookbook. The scope of the error is widespread. Our processing tools stripped out bits of code from listings and examples in the book. Since the electronic books are generated from the files we send to the printer, all eBook versions (including Kindle, EPUB, PDF, and Safari editions) were also affected. Please rest assured that the content is up to Erica Sadun's exceptional standards. We have resolved the production issues internally. We will be reprinting and producing new eBook versions of The iOS 5 Developer's Cookbook this week. The problems we encountered do not affect the sample code that Erica hosts on her GitHub repository; this is a print\/eBook-only issue. While we take every measure to avoid problems such as this, sometimes these things do happen. On behalf of Erica, and from all of Pearson, we regret this unfortunate incident. We assure you that we take this very seriously and that we have taken every measure to ensure this won't happen again. Very soon, we will provide customers who have purchased the current printing with information on identifying whether your book was affected. We will explain how to obtain a replacement. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused and thank you for your patience while we prepare the reprint and new eBook editions. Please check here (InformIT.com\/ios5update) and on Erica's site (ericasadun.com) for more information.
